This project involved designing a database for employee and department data using SQL.
An ERD was created to model the relationships between key tables like Employees, Salaries, Departments, and Titles. 
SQL queries were written to analyze employee information, including details such as salary, department, and manager assignments.
The database schema was created with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity across all tables.
